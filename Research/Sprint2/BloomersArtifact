As a developer, I need to identify which storage platform to use so we have a place to host solution data.

  Search the web for different storage platforms.
  AWS
    Pros:
    With a single PUT operation, you can upload a single object up to 5 GB in size.
    Relatively unlimited amount of storage
    Cons:
    Could be potential cost in the future
  GITLAB
    Pros:
    Majorly focused on DevOps
    Cons:
    The storage limit is 10GB
    The gitlab.com site has a configured limit of 10MBs for file/attachment uploads.
  GITHUB
    Pros:
    GitHub doesn't have any set disk quotas. So each user has access to an abundant amount of storage.
    Cons:
    Strict limit of files exceeding 100 MB in size
  Icedrive
    Pros:
    Only cloud storage solution to support Twofish Encryption. Everything is encrypted at the client-side with zero knowledge of your data
    It allows you to store files up to 100 TB.
    No time-consuming Sync Needed as you can Mount IceDrive with a simple click.
    Cons:
    Only given 10GB of storage

Communicate with Boeing to find out which storage platform they would prefer to use.
